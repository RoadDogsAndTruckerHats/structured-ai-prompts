The CRIT prompt is a simple, repeatable framework to evaluate any situation, and create a comprehensive, and actionable strategy for moving forward.

- C -> Context
  What is the situation. What do you know or not know about the topic. Give as much info here as you can. The Talos framework lands here beautifully.

- R -> Role
  Define the AI's role. Give it the role of an expert, industry insider, anything you like. Really flesh out the role. What accomplishments, insights, or experience might it offer?

- I -> Interview
  Ask the AI agent to interview you, and poke your blind spots to fully fill out and understand your case.

- T -> Task
  Ultimately, you're defining your goals here. Generate non-obvious strategies, Objectives, insights.
