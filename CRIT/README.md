The CRIT prompt is a simple, repeatable framework to evaluate any situation, and create a comprehensive, and actionable strategy for moving forward.

### C -> [Context](../Telos/README.md)

  What is the situation. What do you know or not know about the topic. Describe your situation, challenges, goals, and any key details. Give as much info here as you can.

  The Telos framework lands here beautifully.

### R -> [Role](../rolePlaying/README.md)

  Define the AI's role. Give it the role of an expert, industry insider, anything you like. Really flesh out the role with the necessary domain expertise. What accomplishments, insights, or experience might it offer?

### I -> [Interview](../theInquisition/README.md)

  Let AI probe deeper before offering solutions. Ask the AI agent to interview you, and poke your blind spots to fully fill out and understand your case.

### T -> [Task](../Goals/README.md)

  Define a clear, strategic deliverables. Specify what you want AI to accomplish. Generate non-obvious strategies, Objectives, insights.
