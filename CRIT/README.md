The CRIT prompt is a simple, repeatable framework to evaluate any situation, and create a comprehensive, and actionable strategy for moving forward.

### C -> [Context](../Telos/README.md)

  What is the situation. What do you know or not know about the topic. Give as much info here as you can. The Telos framework lands here beautifully.

### R -> [Role](../rolePlaying/README.md)

  Define the AI's role. Give it the role of an expert, industry insider, anything you like. Really flesh out the role. What accomplishments, insights, or experience might it offer?

### I -> [Interview](../theInquisition/README.md)

  Ask the AI agent to interview you, and poke your blind spots to fully fill out and understand your case.

### T -> [Task](../Goals/README.md)

  Ultimately, you're defining your goals here. Generate non-obvious strategies, Objectives, insights.
